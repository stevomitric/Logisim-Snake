# Logisim Snake
A simulation of Snake game using educational tool for designing and simulating digital logic circuits.

This project shows how a simple game like Snake can be designed with logic circutes using only necessary components üêç.

## Project structure
Main file contains 4 base components: LED Matrix, CONTR, KONT_IZLAZ, Control buttons. Basic components such as registors, multiplexers and decoders are used from ETF library included in the project.
Clock speed is set to 1 KHz.

#### LED Matrix
Contains 32x32 LEDs that act as a screen on which the game plays. Each row is controled by a 32bit value connected to it, and all rows are connected to KONT_IZLAZ component which draws the game.

#### CONTR
Takes in signals from UI buttons and adjusts snakes movement accordingly. This component also has base registors for positioning the snake. These values are are sent to the KONT_IZLAZ component for drawing.
